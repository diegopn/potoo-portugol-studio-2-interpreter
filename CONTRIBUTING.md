## Changes to language behavior

- Add tests for new syntax, runtime behavior, diagnostics, and resource limits where applicable.
- Keep the documented Portugol Studio 2.0 dialect and host-dependent library features explicit. Do not claim behavior that has not been implemented and verified.
- Keep public documentation in English and update it when the API or supported behavior changes.
- Keep changes focused and list the verification commands you ran.
- Preserve existing copyright and license notices. Check the license of any copied third-party material and disclose added dependencies with their purpose and license.
